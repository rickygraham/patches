#[pitch] for Max

I have been porting my Pd(2Live) abstractions over to Max for teaching and performance purposes (I am not defecting).


An object which I rely on quite substantially in Pure Data is the [pitch] object by Olaf Matthes. 


[pitch] organises incoming MIDI note numbers into pitch-class, pitch-class distance and register. 


This is a useful abstraction for organising incoming instrumental pitch data detected by [sigmund~] or [fiddle~].
