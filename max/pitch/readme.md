#[pitch] for Max

I have been porting my Pd(2Live) abstractions over to Max for teaching and performance purposes.


An object which I rely on quite substantially in Pure Data is the **[pitch]** object by Olaf Matthes. 


[pitch] organises incoming MIDI note numbers into pitch-class, pitch-class distance and register. 


This is a useful abstraction for organising incoming instrumental pitch data detected by [sigmund~] or [fiddle~].


I have included a Pd abstraction of the [pitch] object as a point of comparison.


Please send any suggestions to *ricky at rickygraham dot net*
